          <p>Hello,</p>
          <p>My name is Logan and I'm passionate about providing quality computer science service in the San Francisco area. I always go above and beyond to ensure I get the job done right the first time. My work stands out because I pay close attention to all details of the job.</p>
          <p>Iâ€™ve been doing computer science work for a while now, and I love it because it gives me the chance to have fun with computer programing by designing applications that everybody loves.</p>
          <p>I look forward to working with you to help meet all your computer science needs.</p>
